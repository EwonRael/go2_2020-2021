# Assignment 2, Live coding

## Context

This is the 1st assignment for the first semester coding course in the graphic design department at KABK, lead by James Bryan Graves.

## Description

3 - 5 minute long live browser/coding experience by manipulating the HTML DOM structure, CSS and content of an existing website to tell an engaging nartive to the audience. Javascript and CSS injection will be used to create the audio and visual experience.

This is slightly different than live coding or algoraves, as we will *NOT* be diving into the multitude of tools available for those experiences, but rather will leverage the browser itself to server as the coding platform.

Only 2 students really took care of documenting their performance last year, so let's fix that this year. ðŸ™‚

## Assessment

Students will be assessed on 2 outputs.

* The performance itself.

* The documentation of the performance.  Can be a video of the performance, a catelog of code, a website, up to the student what medium they prefer ... but documentation should be digital and uploaded to the same git archive as assignment 1 (we'll explain what this means in class).  Don't over think/over design this, unless you just really want to ... the bulk of the work should be preparing the performance itself.

## Learning objective

Again, this is more exposure to HTML, CSS, and Javascript ... but will be very difficult to "fake", if people are watching you code live.  You will need to know how the code you are enter is actually working, and what the consequences are ...

Further more, doing websites very large and with a narative, it will become very clear how very simple tweaks can have huge consequences, and you will need to really think about the experience and the connection to the audience.
